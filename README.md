# machine-learning-beginner-jupyter-series

This tutorial is focused on really beginners that want to go into machine learning domain contains whole step from `Feature Engineering`, `Model Building`, `Model Selection`, `Model Evalution`. This tutorial also contain some `Linear Algebra` really basic explain that could be used in both machine learning and deep learning. If you want to get some plot usecase that this series also contain really basic use case using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`. If you are just beginner to python, this also contains some `data structures` in pure python implement!
